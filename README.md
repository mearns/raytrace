win32
-----
You'll need to download the gtk+ 2 dependencies:
http://www.gtk.org/download/win32.php

The 'All-in-one' bundle for GTK+ 2.x is suggested, it has all the tools and libraries required.
http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtk+/2.24/gtk+-bundle_2.24.10-20120208_win32.zip

You'll need to set paths appropriately to build & run the raytrace application.
